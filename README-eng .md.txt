## Introduction
Cryptocurrency is a modern decentralized payment instrument that has an extremely wide range of capabilities and removes many of the limitations inherent in traditional payment systems. For example, it allows you to make payments anonymously and securely. It also has no geographical restrictions or obligations, which allows you to access and make payments from anywhere. Such systems use the Internet as an environment.

## Features and specifics
As part of a payment instrument in online stores, cryptocurrency has some features that are unique to this payment instrument. Attempts to integrate it into existing sales systems have led to the search for solutions for convenient and efficient use by users. First of all, this is the so-called confirmation period, which is typical for any cryptocurrency payment system, but is absent as a definition for traditional means of payment. In this case, the software takes over this task, performing all checks in the background automatically, without forcing the user to wait in front of a browser window to complete the payment. After confirming the payment, the system will change the status of the order and send a message to the e-mail address. You can also observe the receipt of confirmations on the payment page.

## Payment Plugin
This article will discuss the first payment plugin for the national Ukrainian exchange system "Karbovanets" ("Carbo"). The extension is written for a fairly early version of the OpenCart platform. This was done to maintain backward compatibility with other versions of the CMS, so you can expect releases for newer versions. Currently, our store is currently working on this edition.
The system works completely automatically and does not require any interference in its work. The main task that solves this extension is the automatic processing of payments. When creating a new order, the user will be added to the choice of a new method of payment "Carbo", which will provide all the necessary information on further work for successful payment. After that, the user will be redirected to a special page where you can make a payment and monitor its execution. Also at the same time the order will be generated and details will be sent for payment to the contact address of the buyer. After payment and confirmation of payment, information about the change of the order's status and the reason for the change will be sent to the user's e-mail address. All that remains for this buyer is to wait for the appropriate phone call from the manager to agree on delivery, if necessary. At this time, the funds for the order are already in the store's wallet. Therefore, from now on it remains only to process the order.

## Technical features
An active payment processing service is required for the plugin to work. At present, there are three types for such a solution: the classic SimpleWallet console wallet, which is running in service mode; WalletD - profile service of virtual wallets; payment gateway from KRB developers (recommended option). The plug-in is able to work effectively with all these services.
The plugin's payment processor requires the ability to perform background operations. This is done using a well-known CRON-based solution, so this option should be available on the hosting where the store operates. Also, if you are using virtual hosting, then in any case you will need the ability to make requests to external services, which is not always available, so be sure to make sure this is possible with support services. If it is impossible to make such requests, the plugin will not work.

## Payment service settings
For the plugin to work, you need an active service to perform payment transactions. We will be the first to consider a payment service from KRB developers, as it is suitable for solving the problem as the most convenient and fast. It is extremely easy to use. All you have to do is go to the website of the service, create a new wallet and carefully record all the data of your wallet. You should also note that this service does not offer full-fledged wallets, so to access the funds you need to install the appropriate keys in your wallet program. Only in this case it will be possible to dispose of the funds received for the order.
You can use the conservative and more classic Simplewallet wallet by running it in service mode. It will require an active and accessible KRB cryptocurrency node, as well as a computer with a network connection or a remote server to host the wallet service.

## Plugin installation
The current version of the plugin is very easy to install. To do this, unzip the extension distribution to the root directory of the store. Next, go to the section with applications, where you select the unit with means of payment and find in the list "Karbo". After installation, go to the plugin settings, where we see a list of parameters. The most important are: the address (the address of the store's walletwell), the host and port of the payment service. In the first parameter we specify the address of the generated wallet. If a payment service from KRB developers is selected for operation, the fields with connection settings can be left untouched, as they are specified by default. Then you need to enable the plugin by selecting the appropriate item. If you only want to use this form of payment for certain regions, you can customize it. If necessary, specify the desired number of confirmations (recommended range of values: 6-10).
For the payment processor to work, you need to configure CRON, specifying a line to run with a time of 5 minutes (domain must specify your own): wget -O / dev / null -q http://krb-shop.pp.ua/index.php?route= p ... carbo / cron.
